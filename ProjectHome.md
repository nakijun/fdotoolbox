## **PLEASE READ**: FDO Toolbox has moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/jumpinjackie/fdotoolbox) ##

FDO Toolbox is an multi-purpose geospatial tool to create, analyse, process and manage spatial data. It is written in C# and uses the Feature Data Objects (FDO) API (http://fdo.osgeo.org)

FDO Toolbox (1.1 and newer) requires .net Framework 4.0. Older releases require 2.0 SP1

For a list of main features, [click here](http://code.google.com/p/fdotoolbox/wiki/Features)

Disclaimer: Know what you are doing before trying this on production-quality geospatial data.

A [companion project site](http://fdotoolbox-addins.googlecode.com) has been setup for the development of add-ins.

If you would like to support this project, please consider donating. Any donations to fund further development of FDO Toolbox while not required, is always appreciated.
